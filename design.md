The Top 7 Metrics that I am planning on using are
    Success Rate, Failure Rate, Transfer Rate and Abandonment Rate
    Avg Cost per Call
    Avg Handle time
    Transfer Rate
    Average Interruptions per Call
    First Call Resolution Rate
    Average Total Latency

Filters
    Date Ranges
    Agents
    Type of Calls(Inbound, Outbound)
    Call Duration

Visualisations
    Used KPI cards for all the metrics and some percentages within the KPI cards
    Used Pie Charts, Bar Charts and Cumulative Distribution Charts for the agent wise split of metrics so that it's easier to compare them.

Possible improvements
    The data can be analysed to enhance the effectiveness of the Agents
    There could be a filter added to stop the agent temperorily if the agent's success rate falls below a specific amount to find issues and optimise it.
